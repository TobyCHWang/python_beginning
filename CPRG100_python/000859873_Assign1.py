# Create a new python file and name it as: StudentIDNumber_Assign1.py

# Create a string variable, and set it equal to your first name.
firstName="Chih-hung"
# Create a two element list of integers, where the:
# a. First element is the current year (integer type)
# b. Second element is the year you were born (integer type)
year = [2021,1994]


# Print to the user your name followed by your age by taking the difference of the two elements in the list.

print("My first name is {0} and my age is {1} years old.".format(firstName, year[0] - year[1]))


# Write three comments at the end of your program:

# a. Write two differences between lists and dictionaries.
# 1. difference: List is an ordered set of elements.
# Dictionary is a data structure that is used for matching one element (Key) with another (Value) and is unordered.
# 2. difference: The index values in list can be used to access a particular element. Index value should be integer
# in dictionary key represents index. Key may be a number of a string.

# b. Write one similarity between lists and dictionaries.
# 1. similarity: List and Dictionary are mutable datatypes
